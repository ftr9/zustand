# ZUSTAND STATE MANAGEMENT with react + typescript ❤❤

1. less boiler plate than redux
2. by default the state is immutable
3. the state can be made mutable with zustand middleware
   just by importing it
   import {immer} from 'zustand/middleware/immer'
4. can be made similar to redux one like creating action ,dispatching and reducing ..
